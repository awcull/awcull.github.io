##Season 13

Season 13 saw a lot of meta changes with [Black Rock Mountain Adventure](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/expansions-adventures/blackrock-mountain/) being released each week through April.  This brought on new cards and a new popular deck using [Grim Patron](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Grim_Patron) in Warrior to flood the board.  As well as the resurgence of Zoo decks with [Imp Gang Boss](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Imp_Gang_Boss).  For me it was a learning experience in deck building, with some failing to capture the former glory such as my mid range hunter and adapting to play a new card, [Flamewaker](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Flamewaker), to play a tempo mage deck.

###Warlock

####Handlock

This was a deck I had hoped to continue to learn from last season.  Unforunately, the heavy aggro meta caused me to abandon this deck quite quickly without really getting a chance to play it.


|       Deck        | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Warlock: Handlock |        6        |  2   |   4    |  0   |  0-1-0   |   0-0-0   |  0-2-0  |   1-1-0    |   1-0-0   |   0-0-0   |   0-0-0    |   0-0-0    |

###Hunter

####Mid range

Mid range hunter has always been a staple deck for me.  It provides a decent early game followed up by one of the best mid range power of any deck using Piloted Shredders, Sludge Beltchers, and Savanah Highmanes along side Freezing Traps to deter aggression.  
This season I changed my old mid range deck to include some new cards like [Emperor Thaurissan](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Emperor_Thaurissan) and an old but powerful card Ragnaros.  Unforunately, the deck was now to slow and failed in the meta, so switched back to my previous mid range deck for a few games.


|      Deck      | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|  Hunter: Mid   |       15        |  7   |   8    |  0   |  2-4-0   |   0-0-0   |  1-1-0  |   1-2-0    |   1-0-0   |   0-0-0   |   0-0-0    |   2-0-0    |
| Hunter: Mid v2 |        6        |  5   |   1    |  0   |  1-0-0   |   0-0-0   |  0-0-0  |   0-0-0    |   0-0-0   |   0-0-0   |   2-0-0    |   1-1-0    |

####Face

Not much to say here, I just don't like the deck.  It either works really well or it fails hard.


|     Deck     | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Hunter: Face |        7        |  3   |   4    |  0   |  0-0-0   |   2-1-0   |  1-1-0  |   0-0-0    |   0-1-0   |   0-0-0   |   0-1-0    |   0-0-0    |

###Mage

####Mech

My old stand by deck has not changed to much.  Still provides a consistant game and still strong in the meta.  Not much else to be said, one of the best decks to climb with still.


|     Deck      | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Mage: Mech v5 |       20        |  16  |   4    |  0   |  2-0-0   |   4-0-0   |  1-1-0  |   1-1-0    |   3-0-0   |   0-1-0   |   2-1-0    |   1-0-0    |

####Aggro

This deck was from the Chinese scene and is very aggro.  The essense of the deck is a lot of cheap spells combined with Flamewaker and Mana Wyrm to clear deal damage before the opponent can stabalize.  Unforunately this has the same issue as Face Hunter, it either works really well or fails hard.  In the end it was a fun deck, just did not seem to click well with its all or nothing style.


|    Deck     | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Mage: Aggro |        6        |  4   |   2    |  0   |  0-0-0   |   1-0-0   |  2-0-0  |   0-0-0    |   0-0-0   |   0-0-0   |   1-1-0    |   0-0-0    |

####Tempo

My new favorite deck.  With the addition of Flamewaker to the old tempo mage decks, it has become a new favorite on the ladder.  It provides a strong early game that can snowball like mech or aggro but also a mid and late game aspect to help close games where the early game may fail.  My loss streak with this deck was due to still learning the mulligan phase and early game.  I was playing combo cards prematurely before I could combo such as dropping Sorcerer's Apprentice turn 2 with no spells to play on the turn instead of playing a spell to beef up Mana Wyrm.  Still, strong deck and again my new favorite ladder deck.


|    Deck     | Number of Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Mage: Tempo |       27        |  15  |   12   |  0   |  1-2-0   |   4-4-0   |  4-1-0  |   1-2-0    |   0-1-0   |   1-0-0   |   2-2-0    |   2-0-0    |

##Next Season

My goal for next season is to try and hit rank 5 or better.  As well as try to branch out to other classes like Druid or Paladin, but need to gather gold or dust to unlock class staples such as Ancient of Lore or Tyrion.
