##Season 15

Well, season is over and did not make my goal of rank 5 or better.  

This season I spent more time at the rank 8 range, which means playing against better opponents more often.  In the end I did learn a lot, such as how hard it is to play freeze mage which I feel I will play more of in up coming seasons.  As well as planning turns in advance instead of dumping creatures as fast as possible.  The most important thing I learned is not to play when not having a good day or more likely playing late at night when should just sleep.

This season I also was able to craft [Alexstrasza](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Alexstrasza), opening up more deck options for the future as well as being able to play freeze mage this season.

###Warlock

####Mid Aggro

This deck still proving to be very effective against most classes.  A change was made to help in the Aggro match ups was the [Void Terror](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Void_Terror).  This exploits the fact that a lot of aggro decks do not run [Big Game Hunter](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Big_Game_Hunter) and gives another egg activation.

####Handlock

Although this deck should still work, it is not the type of deck I'm use to playing and still make to many mistakes with it.  It has fallen out of favor though, being replaced by the Malygos Warlock.


|       Deck        | # Games | W | L | T | Win % | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Rogue | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |

###Hunter

####Mid range

Mid range hunter still performing well with no real bad match ups, it still one of my fall back decks.


|      Deck      | # Games | W  | L | T | Win % | Vs Druid | Vs Hunter | Vs Mage | Vs Paladin | Vs Priest | Vs Rogue | Vs Shaman | Vs Warlock | Vs Warrior |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-----:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|

###Mage

####Freeze

Freeze mage feels like a fun deck but requires a lot of practice and thought to be put into a turns play as it can very much effect future turns unlike a lot of aggro or mid range decks that I tend to play.  The big problem was the amount of warriors on the ladder in my ranks.  Armor effects really hinder this deck that is about surviving until bursting your opponent down.

Unfortunately I am missing [Bloodmage Thalnos](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Bloodmage_Thalnos), which adds much more of a threat to the board compared to the Novice Engineer which fit the 2-mana slot and gives card draw.  Although this is not a bad replacement, it would be nice to obtain Thalnos in the future.

####Tempo

Tempo mage is back in a new form using some mechs to add spare parts and provide creature threats.  Although did not play this deck much, I did see it with very small variations all through out the ladder.

##Next Season

Goal for next season is to reach at least rank 5 and play more freeze mage or malygos warlock.
