Hi,  I'm Andrew W. Cull, software developer and analyst living in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

In the past during as an undergraduate studying physics at the University of Manitoba, I was fortunate to join a project developing software to optimize cancer treatment using external beam radiation therapy.  
After graduating, I took a few courses in computer science before joining the CanDrive project, a longitudinal study of older drivers across Canada.  In my role there, I worked on data management and analysis of the
gathered GPS data.  As well in 2014, I started [Bit Recursion Software][bitrec] as I started to become more interested in mobile application development and to work with others on data issues.

Beyond work, I can be found biking, brewing beer/wine, playing video games, or reading.
